			<h1>Attack on titans</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="Plot">
			<p>
				At the center of the events of Attack on Titans are three heroes: the doctor's son Eren Yeager, his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman and their childhood friend Armin Arlert.  At the beginning of the manga, the titans, led by an unseen previously intelligent "colossal titan" and "armored titan", invade their home district of Shinganshin, breaking through a gate in the outer wall - Eren and Mikasa's mother dies, and they themselves, together with Armin, are forced to seek shelter behind the inner walls.  At the same time, Eren's father, Grisha Yeager, before leaving, leaves his son a mysterious key to the basement in Shingansin, captured by the titans.  Eren vows revenge on the Titans, and all three join the army.

			The action resumes five years later, when the grown heroes graduate from the military school.  The heroes, along with their training class, are in Trost County, a fortified southern settlement near the second wall.  Trost, like Shingansina, is attacked by the Titans;  the armed UPM army tries to resist them, but is defeated, and some of the soldiers, including Eren, are eaten by the titans.  After some time, a new intelligent titan comes to the aid of people, hostile towards his relatives - later the heroes recognize him as Eren, who discovered in himself the ability to temporarily turn into a titanium.  Command uses an unexpected Titan ally to retake Trost and repair the hole in the gate.  Eren is judged to pose a potential danger to humanity, but he is taken under his wing by a reconnaissance unit led by Erwin Smith and Captain Levi, and Eren's friends also join this unit.

			A reconnaissance detachment in a new composition goes beyond the walls, on an expedition to the destroyed Shinganshin, but on the way it is attacked by another, previously unseen intelligent "titan-woman" - this creature not only surpasses other titans in speed and strength, but is able to control them with the help of a cry  ...  The heroes discover that the sentient titan is a werewolf, like Eren, and make an unsuccessful attempt to capture the enemy;  female titan demonstrates military training and - in human form - the ability to use the UPM.  Although the expedition is defeated, upon returning beyond the walls, the heroes are able to figure out the real identity of the female titan - Annie Leonhart, a former cadet from the same training class as themselves.  The scouting party traps Annie in Stohess County by the inner wall - in the ensuing battle of the titans, Eren defeats Annie.  The heroes discover that sleeping titans are also located inside the walls that protect the city.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			Soon, the reconnaissance squad is forced to act to repel a new threat - the appearance of titans between the inner walls of Rose and Sin, which may indicate a breakthrough of the second wall somewhere outside Trost.  The heroes encounter a new intelligent titan - "titan-ape" or "bestial" - and discover three more hidden werewolves in their own ranks.  If Bertholt and Reiner - already familiar from the story "colossal" and "armored" titans - are inside the walls with some secret mission, the third werewolf titan Ymir is out of their plans and reluctantly helps them kidnap Eren.  The reconnaissance squad and the military police, through huge losses, manage to recapture Eren from the titans, while Eren discovers the ability to control the titans with the help of a shout - just as Annie had previously done.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			Soon there is another kidnapping - this time Eren and another fighter, the girl Christa, are captured by people from the so-called "Central Department" of the military police, whose orders are given only by members of the royal family.  By this time, the reconnaissance squad realizes that the royal government knows a lot about the titans and werewolves, and enters into a confrontation with him, even planning and carrying out a coup d'etat together with other military personnel.  As it turns out, "Christa" is Historia Reiss, heiress of the real royal dynasty of Reiss, while the reigning king is only a puppet.  The Reiss were also werewolves, passing from one to another the power of the "first king" - the ability to supernaturally control not only titans, but people as well.  Eren's father, Grisha Yeager, already being a werewolf, managed to take possession of the gift of the "first king" (ate Frida Reiss in the guise of a titan, History's half-sister), and then pass it on to his son - as a result, Eren contains the power of two titans, the power of the "Attacking Titan"  , and the power of the "Titan King".  History refuses to obey her own father Rod and inherit the gift, which would mean for her to turn into a titanium and eat Eren alive - Rod turns into a huge, 120-meter titanium himself, but the reconnaissance squad manages to cope with him.  History is crowned as the new rightful queen.

			Having settled the problems inside the walls, the reconnaissance squad sets out on a new expedition to the outer wall - to find and destroy the werewolf titans, as well as get to the basement in Shinganshin, where, as the heroes believe, are the clues to the mysteries.  The squad reaches Shinganshin, but falls into a trap - they are trapped by a whole army of titans and a "monkey", "colossal" and "armored" titans, they are werewolves Zeke, Bertholt and Reiner.  In a long battle, almost the entire reconnaissance detachment perishes, although it leaves behind a battlefield.  Having the opportunity to make one of their comrades a werewolf, the heroes are forced to choose between the seriously wounded Erwin and Armin and choose the latter, letting the commander Erwin die and Armin inheriting the power of the "colossal titan" Bertolt.  They open the basement door and find Grisha Yeager's diaries and a photograph inside - a piece of technology that does not exist in the world inside the walls known to the heroes.

			Although the heroes previously believed that humanity outside the walls was destroyed by the titans, in fact, there are other cities and countries in the outside world where Eren's father came from.  The walls are on the isolated island of Paradise, while the continent on the other side of the strait is ruled by the state of Marly.  Once the Marli people - "ordinary" people - were enslaved by the Eldians, the descendants of Queen Ymir: only the Eldians can turn into titans, and among them the unique gifts of werewolves are passed on.  A hundred years before the events of the manga, the Marlians overthrew the Eldians and drove their enemies into the ghetto;  the Eldian kings retained their power only on the island within the three rings of the walls.  Grisha Yeager was a member of the Eldian underground movement, and Zeke was his son from his first marriage.  When the movement was discovered, Grisha and his comrades were exiled to the island and turned into foolish titans, but another member of the underground, Eren Kruger, the bearer of the "attacking titan" force, helped Grisha escape and gave him this power, which Grisha later passed on to his son.  The heroes regain control of the outer wall of Maria and prepare for the inevitable war with the Marli.

			The action moves forward four years as the Marley army, including Zeke, Rainer, and young Eldian soldiers in Marley's service, face off against a new adversary, the Alliance of the Middle East.  Although Marley wins the battle thanks to the use of the titans, the superiority of human military technology over the titans of Marley is obvious, and Zeke tells his commanders that Marley cannot maintain his position as a superpower if he does not get the titan forces from Paradise Island.</p>
